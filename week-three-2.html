      <h3>Programming the Attiny with the Arduino</h3>
      <p>AATtiny85 is smallest microcontroller in ATMEL’s AVR family having less
         number of pins. It has 8 pins in total in which 6 pins are for programmable
          Input/Output. It was developed for low power applications such as
          (battery operated applications).<br>
          Before we can program the Attiny85 we need to set the Arduino Uni in
          ISP mode. In the picture below you can see how to do it.<br>
          Arduino IDE didn’t support ATtiny85 so we had to add ATtiny boards to Arduino IDE. <br>
          To do this go to File/Preferences and copy the following link: <br>
          https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damellis/attiny/ide-1.6.x-boards-manager/package_damellis_attiny_index.json <br>
          Then go to the Board manager and find the Attiny and install it.
          You can then see it in the end of the list. <br>
          The next step is to connect the Attiny to the Arduino using the breadboard.
          Keep in mind that you connect it correct. (HOW TO CONNECT)<br>
          Choose the correct processor, clock and programmer. <br>
          When everything is correct you have to Burn Bootloader.<br>
          The next step is to create your code. We coded the melody for our
          card and the blinking LED.<br>
          Open a new toneMelody window and delet everything that is already in
          there and paste your code. <br>
          Then change the pins for the LED and the speaker for those you are going to use.<br>
          I used the Melody of Jingle Bells. You can see the code here.<br>
          Connect your LED and your speaker to your Attiny to be able to see your
          result. I connected the LED to the pin 3 and the speaker to pin 4. Don’t
          forget to put a resistor for your LED!<br>
          Verify your code. If everything is fine, connect your Arduino to your
          computer and upload the code to the Attiny. <br>
          IMPORTANT! Do not upload it with the upload button. Otherwise you have
          to reconnect your Attiny and your Breadboard. <br>
          Upload it using this path: Sketch/Upload Using Programmer
