      <h3>Programming the Arduino</h3>
      <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use
        hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light
        on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it
        into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing s
        omething online. <br>
        You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions
        to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino
        programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE),
        based on Processing.<br>
        First you have to install the Software Arduino. You can find the link
        for the download here.<br>
        When you open the software you can go to file/Examples. <br>
        As you can see Arduino has already example codes, which you can use. <br>
        We used the example Blink for the LED. You can find it when you go to F
        ile/Examples/01.Basics/Blink.<br>
        When you open the example you have to change the pinMode to the number
        of pin you are going to use.<br>
        My LED had the positive in pin 13 and the negative in ground (GND),
        so I changed LED_BUITIN to 13.<br>
        When you want to change the speed of your blinking LED you can change
        the DELAY.<br>
        Verify you code first before you connect your Arduino with your
        computer to make shure there aren’t any problems! <br>
        Connect you Arduino with through a USB cable to your computer and check
        the settings of the board and port.<br>
        When you’re done you can upload your code and your LED starts to blink.
