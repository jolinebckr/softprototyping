      <h1>Week 1</h1>
      <h3>Inflatables</h3>
      <p>In the first week we learned how to make inflatables by ourself.<br>
      We started creating a motif for the inflatable in Illustrator.
      It was important to consider <br>
      where the vinyl paper should be sealed later and where the air should be. At the place <br>
      that was to be sealed, the baking paper was cut out and at the place where
      air should be was the baking paper.<br>
      <!--Image of the sketch-->
      The template was exported to Silhouette Studio, then the baking
      paper was cut. <br>
      <!--Image of the cutted bakingpaper-->
      The same was done with the vinyl. It was important
      to enlarge the template a bit so that the edges could be sealed.<br>
      <!--Image of cutted vinyl-->
      If you had the cutted baking paper and two vinyl paper, you put the
      baking paper between the vinyl and put it in the <br>
      hot press. Then the vinyl was melted for 15 seconds at a temperature of 120 degrees celsius.<br>
      <!--Image of finished inflatable-->
      The finished inflatable was taken out of the hot press and was ready.
      With a small hole, which was put into a small <br>
      opening of the Inflatables, you were now able to blow air inside the inflatable and watch how it inflates.
