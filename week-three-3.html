      <h3>Making a christmas card with light and melody</h3>
      <p>Think about the design. <br>
        I wanted to make a christmas card with sound and light. <br>
        I used Illustrator to make a layout of my card and separated the
        reindeer and the banner to cut them out using Silhoutte. <br>
        Then prepare your electronic circuit. I needed a red LED, a speaker,
        the programmed Attiny and a resistor for the LED.  Calculate which #
        resister you have to use for your LED.  <br>
        drew my design and my circuit on sketching paper to make sure the
        design covers the circuit. <br>
        For the next step you have to put everything on the postcard and solder
        all connections. Be careful when you solder the Attiny. The legs have
        to be seperated and are not allowed to touch each other.
        If they touch you might cause a short circuit. <br>
        My switch was hiding under the banner. I had to think about how to make
        a better switch because the contact was to far away, so I has a tiny
        piece of foam and stick it to my banner. Then I put some copper tape on
        it so I could use it for the switch. <br>
        For the battery and the speaker I made small boxes using the cardboard
        I used for ma Christmas card. I put the batteries under the banner and
        put the speaker next to the reindeer. <br>
