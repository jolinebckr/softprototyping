      <h3>Paper electronics</h3>
      <p>
        First we had to think about a circuit. What we want to do, where do we
        have to put the battery? <br>
        Where do we have to put the switch? And where do you have to put the LED? <br>
        lso you have to make shure that you have enough power for the LEDs. On the
        box with the LEDs <br> you can check how much power you need for each lamp. <br>
        If you thought about this you have to prepare the materials and start s
        ticking the copper tape to <br> the template that was given. <br>
        You can tape the copper in two ways: as one continuos line or you
        can cut the tape to make it <br> look more accurate. When you decide to cut
        the tape you have to solder all the cutted parts, but if <br> you tape the
        copper tape as a continuos line you just have to solder the parts that
        are uneven. For <br> example when you do a rounded circuit, just like I did. <br>
        Before soldering you have to go through secruity instructions and heat your device. <br> <br>
        When itâ€™s heated you have to put the tip of the soldering device to the
        place you want to connect. <br>Then put the soldering metal to the tip and
        melt it to solder the copper tape. <br>
        I first soldered the LED lamps and then soldered the copper tape at the round edges.<br>
        The place the battery in the plase and test it with the switch.<br>
